* IP Addresses in GCP

IP addresses are assigned to the compute resources.
When you are creating any executable instance in GCP,
there must be an IP address associated with it.

There are internal IP address and external IP address.

External IP address is not mandatory, but each VM *must* have internal IP address.

External IP address is used to communicate outside your VPC network or with the Internet.
And that is optional when you are creating the VM.

Internal IP address is used for a VM to communicate with other instances in the same VPC network.
It doesn't matter if they are in the same region or in different regions.
But they communicate with each other using internal IP addresses only.

External IP address is used to communicate with instances in other networks or the Internet.

Internal IP addresses are allocated to instances from the subnet IP range via DHCP.
DHCP is a protocol in the GCP, which allows IP addresses to instances.

Each instance must have their own region and in the VPC, you will get the subnet
for the region so that internal IP associated with the instance must define
within the range of the subnet.

No manual intervention is required to assign internal IP to a VM.
It is automatic.

Internal IP address is ephemeral.
It means internal IP address associated with your resource can be changed.

External IPs are also assigned via DHCP.
Google has some provided pool for external IPs and DHCP protocol will automatically
pick up IP address from the pool.

External IPs are mapped to internal IPs of VM instances.
With the help of external IP, you can access your resources over the Internet.
But that external IP is also associated with the internal IP for an instance.

External IP can be static IP address if needed.

External IP can be both ephemeral and static.

Traffic using external IP address can cause additional billing chages on GCP.
