## Using Kubernetes Namespaces

- I want to create **multiple virtual clusters** inside the same physical Kubernetes cluster. How can I do that?


- Creating a **namespace** is like creating a small virtual cluster in the Kubernetes cluster.


- You can create multiple **namespaces** and attach microservices or pods to each namespace.


- Only the pods in the same namespace can talk to each other.


- So, **namespaces** are recommended for clusters shared between mulitple teams or projects.
