## How to create a Google Cloud Run Service

1. Head over to your GCP console and go to Cloud Run.

2. Click on Create Service.

3. Select the container image by clicking Select and then expand the Artifact Registry section until you see the image.

4. Change the service name accordingly and leave almost all config as they are except for:

- Max. num of instances : 1
- Ingress control : All (allow all HTTP requests to your service)
- Allow unauthenticated invocations

5. Expand the Container, Networking, Security section.

This particular port number is only exposed to Ingress Container.

The main container that listens for incoming traffic is called Ingress Container.

And that container will have this environment variable called $PORT.
And the port number is exposed to that environment variable.

6. Now just go ahead and create a Cloud Run Service.
Now you see the first revision created in the new Service detail section.

We cannot modify the revision that is already created. (immutable)
If we make changes to our code and redeploy the image, then it will create a new revision.


7. To test the new Cloud Run Service, copy the below URL.

And paste it somewhere in the blank document:


https://lab-06-get-customers-svc-chnxaog2yq-uc.a.run.app



chnxaog2yq -> This is the project hash.


Then in a standalone HTTP test file, you can paste the hash code to that file and test it as below:


```
@PROJECT_HASH = chnxaog2yq


###

curl --request GET \
  --url https://lab-06-get-customers-svc-{{PROJECT_HASH}}-uc.a.run.app/getcustomers \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'user-agent: vscode-restclient'

```
