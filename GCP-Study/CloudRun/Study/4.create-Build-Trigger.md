## How to create a Build Trigger in Cloud Build

1. Go to your GCP console and search for Cloud Build.

2. Go to Dashboard and click on 'Set up build triggers'.

3. For Event, choose 'Manual Invocation'. And then 2nd Gen for Source.

4. Also select the Repository we created in GitHub connection.

5. In Configuration settings, you have 3 types:
- Cloud Build configuration file (YAML or JSON)
- Dockerfile
- **Buildpacks** - for Buildpacks, we don't need any configuration file.

Buildpacks is the one we want to start with.

6. / Build directory is where your code is.
In this case, our source code is in:

'''
lab-6-build-and-deploy-cloud-run-service-using-buildpacks/microservices/customers
'''

7. Put in the image name and builder image. (as automatically entered or viewed in the entry space)

8. And we are not going to provide any service account, which means that we will use the default service accout.

That default service account has access to push the images to Artifact Registry.

9. Click on create now.

10. Once the trigger is created, click on Run on the far right side, and click Run Trigger.

11. And unfortunately in my case, I couldn't get through the quota issue here.
So my trigger build failed. It seems like the reason is because I use a free tier account.

So I get this message, but this is how you build a build trigger in Cloud Build.
