## What is Artifact Registry?

- Artifact Registry provides you a single location for managing your app packages and Docker container images.

- It allows you to store the following:
  - store artifacts from Cloud Build
  - deploy artifacts to GCP runtimes such as GKE, Cloud Run, Compute Engine, and App Engine.
  - manage container metadata and scan for container vulnerabilities with Artifact Analysis.
  - enforce deployment policies with Binary Authorization.

Also, you can control who can access Artifact Registry or not by using Identity and Access Management.
