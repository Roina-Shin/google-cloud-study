GCP Deployment Manager provides automation and orchestration.

Instead of using Google Cloud console and Cloud Shell to deploy solutions in steps,
Deployment Manager lets you do automation of deployment process.

Go to the Marketplace and search for a solution.

Choose one and configure it and click deploy.
Then you are taken to the Deployment Manager page.

All the manual works including VM creation, firewall rules creation, external IP address assignment, etc.
are automated and orchestrated with the Deployment Manager.

You can also delete the deployment in the same page by simply clicking delete.

Deployment Manager is the infrastructure as a code tool for GCP.
It is recommended for dynamically provisioning VMs on Compute Engine

By defining the VM specifications in a configuration file and using Deployment
Manager, you can easily create and manage multiple VM instances in an automated
and scalable manner.

You have updated the deployment definition file to add a new Compute Engine instance.
You need to update the deployment on GCP but you cannot afford downtime for any resources.
