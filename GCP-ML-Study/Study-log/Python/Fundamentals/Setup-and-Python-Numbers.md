## Installing Python

- When you install Python, you can go to the search in the windows toolbar and search 'Python'. If you click the program, you will get the shell where you can interact with Python.

- You can get out of here by **exit()**.


- Then open your VS Code, and create a demo py file. If it is your first time creating it, you will get the message saying that 'Do you want to install python extension?'. Click yes.

- Once done, go with **select a Python Interpreter** option (check it) and select the Python file path accordingly. Now, you activated so that the VS code knows you installed Python. Go back to your Python file and do **print("hello world")** and save and click the play button, it will open up a terminal for you.

- Then, run this:


```
pip install ipython
```

- If the installation doesn't work, you can instead use **replit** site to simulate a Python environment.

## Integers and Floats

- Integers are whole numbers. No decimal points. Posive or Negative.

- e.g.) 9, 278, -23


- Floats are written with decimal points. Negative or Positive.

- e.g.) 8.1, 1.2345, 0.5


## Operands and Operators

- Python performs operations using operators (+, -, *, /) and operands (numbers or values).

### Exponentiation (**)

- It's how we raise one number to another power. 4 ** 3 means 4 to the power of 3 which is 64.

### Integer Division (//)

- If you do a regular division ( / ) 10 / 3 = 3.33333333333335.


- But if you do a **integer division**, 10 // 3 = 3.

### Modulo (%)

- It will get the **remainder** as a result of a division. 38 % 10 = 8

## Variables

- We can store a value and give it a name so that we can:

  - Refer back to it later

  - Use that value to do...stuff

  - Change it later on

## Assignment Operators

### += operator

- The += operator will take the current value of the variable and update it to be the current value + another value.

### *= operator

- It will do the same thing but multiply the value by the number outside of it.
