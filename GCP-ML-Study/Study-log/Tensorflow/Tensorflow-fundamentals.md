## Deep Learning with Tensorflow

### What is deep learning?

- Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.



### Why use machine learning?

- For a complex problem, can you think of all the rules?


- You can use ML for literally anything as long as you can convert it into numbers and program it to find patterns.



### What are neural networks?

- We have some inputs (picture, sound, etc.) and turn those into some numerical encoding. Then our neural network we have chosen for our specific problem will learn **representation** referred to as patterns, features, weights, etc. We will create some representation output (transformed numerical output) based on the patterns it has figured out, and we define what our output will look like.

### Deep Learning Use Cases

- Recommendation


- Translation


- Speech recognition


- Computer vision


- Natural Language Processing


- Classification/Regression



### What is TensorFlow?

- Tensorflow is an end-to-end platform for machine learning.


- Write fast deep learning code in Python/other accessible languages (able to run or a GPU/TPU)


- Able to access many pre-built deep learniing models (TensorFlow Hub)



### What is Tensor?

- Tensors are a numerical way to represent your data. 



### TensorFlow Workflow

1. Get data ready. (turn into tensors)


2. Build or pick a pre-trained model. (to suit your problem)


3. Fit the model to the data and make a prediction.


4. Evaluate our model.


5. Improve through experimentation.


6. Save and reload your trained model.
